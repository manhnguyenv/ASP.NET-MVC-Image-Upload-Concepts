This small app was developed to test out MS MVC's file uploading capabilities and as a proof of concept for being able to do server-side image resizing (e.g., thumbnail generation) as an image was uploaded. The inspiration for this comes from the Ruby on Rails world - specifically a GEM called PaperClip.

The bulk of the code in this project was generated by the various Visual Studio 2013 Wizards as well as a couple of articles found via Google (why reinvent the wheel!) There were 2 main articles used:

* [PaperClip for ASP.NET MVC](stackoverflow.com/questions/5013824/paperclip-for-asp-net-mvc)
* [Image Tag Helper for ASP.NET MVC](http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/Blogs/8622/Asp-Net-mvc-imagefor-htmlhelper.aspx)

This app is NOT production-quality. The code was developed for proof-of-concept only. Feel free to download, cut it up, use parts of it in any way desired.
